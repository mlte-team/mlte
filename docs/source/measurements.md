# Measurements

MLTE offers the following measurements:
* local_process_cpu_utilization: CPU utilization measurement for local training processes
* local_process_memory_consumption: Memory consumption measurement for local training processes
* local_object_size: Storage capacity measurement for locally-stored objects

If these measurements are insufficient for your project's needs, please see the MLTE guide [link to be added] to using external functions and types.
