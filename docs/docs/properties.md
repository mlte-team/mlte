# Properties

*Properties* are characteristics of the trained model, the procedure used to train it (including training data), or its ability to perform inference.

## MLTE Properties

* Functionality
    * Task Efficacy (e.g., Prediction Accuracy, Error Rate, etc)
    * Fairness
    * Interpretability
* Robustness
    * Robustness to Naturally Occurring Data Challenges
    * Robustness to Adversarial Attack
    * Robustness to Device-Generated Perturbations
    * Security
* Costs
    * Model Size
    * Training Costs
    * Inference Performance
