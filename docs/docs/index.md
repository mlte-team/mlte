## Introduction

`MLTE` (pronounced "melt") is a Python library containing an infrastructure for machine learning (ML) test and evaluation. `MLTE` enables teams to more effectively negotiate, document, and evaluate model and system qualities. 

## Getting Started with MLTE

- If you're ready to jump right in, we recommend you head over to the [Getting Started](getting_started.md) section.
- If you're new to `MLTE` and want a primer before you dive in, we welcome you to read our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01998" target="_blank">paper</a> (don't worry, it's only 5 pages).
- If you have no time for papers but want a more deliberate introduction to `MLTE`, check out the [Tutorials](tutorial0.md) section.

## More Information
