Pre-Demo Steps:
 - Execute Demo steps from https://mlte.readthedocs.io/en/latest/development/#quickstart. 
 - Ensure that Docker daemon is running.
 - Execute run_environment.sh from demo/scenarios.
 - (Optional) Install wget
 - Execute all notebooks so that the results can be seen in the notebooks themselves.

Demo:
 - Start with slides explaining what MLTE is.
 - Continue slides including a diagram of the whole process. Use this diagram later with more slides to indicate where in the process we are as we move forward through the demo.
 - Log into frontend (browser, localhost:8000), show Negotiation Card. Explain important parts of negotiation card and how it is refined.
 - Open the Jupyter Notebook with Spec (the one in demo/scenarios/1_requirements.ipynb. Skip the Negotiation Card definition, but do show the context initialization, and then the Spec definition. Walk though it without getting into too many details.
 - Go back to frontend. Show Test Catalog, and show how people would use it find an example of how to measure certain QAS.
 - Open one Jupyter Notebooks with QAS test measurements, the demo/scenarios/2a_evidence_fairness one, and walk through it.
 - Open the demo/scenarios/3_report.ipynb Notebook, and show the process for validating and generating the report.
 - Go back to frontend, and show the report results.
