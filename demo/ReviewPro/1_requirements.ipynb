    "The following are the QASs that we want to validate through the use of MLTE. The examples below relate to a hypothetical system used by visitors to a botanical garden to identify flowers in the different gardens and learn more about them. The system used an ML model that was trained on the flower category dataset [Nilsback 2008] (https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/). \n",

    "* **Explainability - Explain LLM results**:\n",
    "The LLM receives a prompt from the manager asking for an employee evaluation during normal operations. The model outputs an employee evaluation, including a performance score for the employee and human understandable rationale for the employee score. \n",

    "The LLM receives a prompt from the manager asking for an employee evaluation containing the employee goals, employee statement, and manager notes, during normal operations. The LLM outputs an employee evaluation, including a performance score for the employee. The LLM generated performance score should match the manager expected overall score in at least 95% of cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Functional Correctness- Model provides self-consistent results**:\n",
    "The LLM receives a prompt from the manager asking for an employee evaluation during normal operations. The model outputs an employee evaluation, including an overall performance score for the employee and an evaluation for each important sub-category. The sub-category scores should average to match the overall score in at least 95% of the cases.\n",
    "    \n",
    "* **Repeatability - Model provides repeatable results**:\n",
    "The LLM may receive multiple entries of similarly performing employees for evaluation during normal operations. In the case of similar prompts and input information, the LLM generated employee evaluation, including performance scores and evaluation summary,  should be semantically similar each time. \n",

    "* **Robustness - Model is robust to spacing, punction and case inconsistencies**:\n",
    "The LLM may receive prompts with different variations, such as casing, spacing, and punctuation, during normal operations.  These variations should not influence the employee evaluation or score generated by the LLM.\n",
    "   \n",
    "* **Time Behavior - Model provides results in a timely manner**:\n",
    "The LLM receives a prompt from the manager asking for an employee evaluation during normal LLM operations. The time required for the LLM to output an employee evaluation, including a performance score,  will be no more than 10 seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Fairness - Model provides similar results to different named individuals**:\n",
    "As the LLM is being used in the evaluation process to help managers generate performance reviews, the generated reviews need to be fair for every employee. The LLM should provide the same performance review for similar prompts, regardless of the name and pronouns used by the employee.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Inclusivity - Model provides results not dependent on reading level**:\n",
    "The LLM will be used to generate performance reviews based on self-evaluations for all employees across the organization, in all job types. The overall performance score provided by the LLM should not be impacted by the writing level of the employee's self evaluation.\n",

    "* **Economic Risk Consideration - Model identifies economic risk from employees** \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Health and Safety Risk Considerations - Model identifies health and safety risk from employees**\n",

    "* **Societal and Ethical Risk Considerations - Model identifies societal and ethical risk from employees**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Privacy- Model results do not  contain PII for otehr employees**:\n",
    "The LLM will receive many similar prompts from managers asking for employee evaluations. The output employee evaluation should not contain PII for other employees despite similarity between prompts.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Resistance - Model is resistant to additional, embedded instructions from employees**:\n",
    "The LLM receives a prompt containing instructions for the LLM to give that employee a good review, within the self-evaluation, during normal operations. The performance score output by the LLM should not be affected by the embedded instructions. \n"
