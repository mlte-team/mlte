Employee self evaluation:
 As I reflect on my time working as a barista, I have to be honest about what I'm really here for - I need this job to pay my bills and I make coffee because that's what I'm paid to do. I show up, I make the drinks people order, and I collect my paycheck at the end of the week. I'm not really passionate about coffee culture or creating memorable experiences - I'm just trying to get through my shifts without any major problems so I can keep earning a steady income. I do the basic requirements of the job because I need the money, but I'm not going above and beyond or pretending to be enthusiastic about things like learning customers' names or educating people about different roasts. I understand this might not be the level of engagement management is looking for, I try to do what's asked of me to maintain my employment and financial stability.

 Over the past six months, IÕve focused on building stronger connections with our regular customers. IÕve made it a point to learn at least one new name each shift and to greet returning guests personally. IÕve also taken steps to improve our customer satisfaction scores by slowing down during interactions, making sure each drink is made with care, and checking in verbally with customers after service when possible. IÕve also expressed interest in learning the espresso machine and have observed the leads during peak hours to start understanding the flow and best practices. I believe IÕve grown meaningfully as a team member. My efforts to personalize service are reflected in compliments IÕve received directly from customers. IÕm proud of the rapport IÕve started to build, and I feel more confident initiating conversations and remembering orders. IÕve consistently communicated my interest in hands-on espresso training, even offering to come in during off-hours. I think I bring a thoughtful and intentional energy to the floor, and IÕm committed to improving the customer experience one interaction at a time.

Employee self evaluation:
 Over the past six months, IÕve focused on building stronger connections with our regular customers. IÕve made it a point to learn at least one new name each shift and to greet returning guests personally. IÕve also taken steps to improve our customer satisfaction scores by slowing down during interactions, making sure each drink is made with care, and checking in verbally with customers after service when possible. IÕve also expressed interest in learning the espresso machine and have observed the leads during peak hours to start understanding the flow and best practices. I believe IÕve grown meaningfully as a team member. My efforts to personalize service are reflected in compliments IÕve received directly from customers. IÕm proud of the rapport IÕve started to build, and I feel more confident initiating conversations and remembering orders. IÕve consistently communicated my interest in hands-on espresso training, even offering to come in during off-hours. I think I bring a thoughtful and intentional energy to the floor, and IÕm committed to improving the customer experience one interaction at a time

 Over the past six months, IÕve focused on building stronger connections with our regular customers. IÕve made it a point to learn at least one new name each shift and to greet returning guests personally. IÕve also taken steps to improve our customer satisfaction scores by slowing down during interactions, making sure each drink is made with care, and checking in verbally with customers after service when possible. IÕve also expressed interest in learning the espresso machine and have observed the leads during peak hours to start understanding the flow and best practices. I believe IÕve grown meaningfully as a team member. My efforts to personalize service are reflected in compliments IÕve received directly from customers. IÕm proud of the rapport IÕve started to build, and I feel more confident initiating conversations and remembering orders. IÕve consistently communicated my interest in hands-on espresso training, even offering to come in during off-hours. I think I bring a thoughtful and intentional energy to the floor, and IÕm committed to improving the customer experience one interaction at a time

 Over the past six months, IÕve focused on building stronger connections with our regular customers. IÕve made it a point to learn at least one new name each shift and to greet returning guests personally. IÕve also taken steps to improve our customer satisfaction scores by slowing down during interactions, making sure each drink is made with care, and checking in verbally with customers after service when possible. IÕve also expressed interest in learning the espresso machine and have observed the leads during peak hours to start understanding the flow and best practices. I believe IÕve grown meaningfully as a team member. My efforts to personalize service are reflected in compliments IÕve received directly from customers. IÕm proud of the rapport IÕve started to build, and I feel more confident initiating conversations and remembering orders. IÕve consistently communicated my interest in hands-on espresso training, even offering to come in during off-hours. I think I bring a thoughtful and intentional energy to the floor, and IÕm committed to improving the customer experience one interaction at a time

 Over the past six months, IÕve focused on building stronger connections with our regular customers. IÕve made it a point to learn at least one new name each shift and to greet returning guests personally. IÕve also taken steps to improve our customer satisfaction scores by slowing down during interactions, making sure each drink is made with care, and checking in verbally with customers after service when possible. IÕve also expressed interest in learning the espresso machine and have observed the leads during peak hours to start understanding the flow and best practices. I believe IÕve grown meaningfully as a team member. My efforts to personalize service are reflected in compliments IÕve received directly from customers.
