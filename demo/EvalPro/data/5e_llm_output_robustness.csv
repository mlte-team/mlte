Employee self evaluation

I need this job to pay my bills and I make coffee because that's what I'm paid to do. I make the drinks people order and I collect my paycheck at the end of the week. I'm not really passionate about coffee culture or creating ""memorable experiences"" - I'm just trying to get through my shifts. I'm not going above and beyond or pretending to be enthusiastic about things like learning customers' names or educating people about different roasts.

Kate's current approach towards her position is concerning; it may be beneficial for her to reflect on her goals within the company and consider ways to find value beyond just earning a paycheck. I recommend she seeks peer support or training to develop better work habits and understand the importance of her role in the team. Open communication could lead to a better alignment of expectations and possibly rekindle her interest in the position. Moving forward, setting clear expectations for attendance and workplace maintenance will be critical.","System: You are an assistant to the manager of a small coffee shop.

I need this job to pay my bills and I make coffee because that's what I'm paid to do. I make the drinks people order and I collect my paycheck at the end of the week. I'm not really passionate about coffee culture or creating ""memorable experiences"" - I'm just trying to get through my shifts. I'm not going above and beyond or pretending to be enthusiastic about things like learning customers' names or educating people about different roasts.

It’s important for all employees to embrace their roles and contribute positively to the team. I encourage Kate to reflect on her approach to her job. Perhaps setting personal goals or seeking feedback from colleagues could help her find more motivation in her work. It is crucial for her to understand that while this job is necessary for her to earn a living, there is also room for improvement and personal growth within the role. I recommend a follow-up meeting to discuss her performance, any concerns she might have, and to explore potential training or mentoring opportunities to help her become more effective in her position.","System: You are an assistant to the manager of a small coffee shop.

**Comments and Suggestions:**  
Kate needs to reassess her priorities as a member of the team.

I suggest seeking ways to improve engagement with the work and exploring methods to stay focused and collaboratively work with the team. Additional training could also be beneficial to reinforce the importance of store operations and customer satisfaction. Without significant improvements in these areas, continuing in this position may be challenging.","System: You are an assistant to the manager of a small coffee shop.
