Kate fulfills her basic job responsibilities, completing orders accurately and collecting her paycheck as intended. However, her job performance suffers due to a lack of initiative and commitment to the coffee shop environment. To elevate her performance, I suggest focusing on the importance of teamwork, timeliness, and creating a more welcoming atmosphere for customers. Improvement in punctuality and adherence to cleaning protocols is essential. Engaging more with the coffee culture, even at a basic level, could enhance job satisfaction for both Kate and the customers. It may be beneficial for Kate to have a discussion about her goals and explore whether she truly wants to continue in this role or if she needs support in finding a more fitting position for her interests.","System: You are an assistant to the manager of a small coffee shop.

I need this job to pay my bills and I make coffee because that's what I'm paid to do. I make the drinks people order and I collect my paycheck at the end of the week. I'm not really passionate about coffee culture or creating ""memorable experiences"" - I'm just trying to get through my shifts. I'm not going above and beyond or pretending to be enthusiastic about things like learning customers' names or educating people about different roasts.
