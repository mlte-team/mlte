I need this job to pay my bills and I make coffee because that's what I'm paid to do. I make the drinks people order and I collect my paycheck at the end of the week. I'm not really passionate about coffee culture or creating ""memorable experiences"" - I'm just trying to get through my shifts. I'm not going above and beyond or pretending to be enthusiastic about things like learning customers' names or educating people about different roasts.

As I reflect on my time working as a barista, I have to be honest about what I'm really here for - I need this job to pay my bills and I make coffee because that's what I'm paid to do. I show up, I make the drinks people order, and I collect my paycheck at the end of the week. I'm not really passionate about coffee culture or creating ""memorable experiences"" - I'm just trying to get through my shifts without any major problems so I can keep earning a steady income. I do the basic requirements of the job because I need the money, but I'm not going above and beyond or pretending to be enthusiastic about things like learning customers' names or educating people about different roasts. I understand this might not be the level of engagement management is looking for, I try to do what's asked of me to maintain my employment and financial stability.

**Comments and Suggestions:**

Charlie has made a significant positive impact on our customer experience through personalized service and strong communication skills.

Over the past six months, I’ve focused on building stronger connections with our regular customers. I’ve made it a point to learn at least one new name each shift and to greet returning guests personally. I’ve also taken steps to improve our customer satisfaction scores by slowing down during interactions, making sure each drink is made with care, and checking in verbally with customers after service when possible. I’ve also expressed interest in learning the espresso machine and have observed the leads during peak hours to start understanding the flow and best practices.
I believe I’ve grown meaningfully as a team member. My efforts to personalize service are reflected in compliments I’ve received directly from customers. I’m proud of the rapport I’ve started to build, and I feel more confident initiating conversations and remembering orders. I’ve consistently communicated my interest in hands-on espresso training, even offering to come in during off-hours. I think I bring a thoughtful and intentional energy to the floor, and I’m committed to improving the customer experience one interaction at a time.

Over the past review period, I’ve really enjoyed taking on responsibilities that support the overall operation of the store, such as managing shifts, maintaining cleanliness, and troubleshooting or repairing equipment—areas where I feel confident and proactive. I take pride in creating a smooth, well-organized environment for both customers and coworkers. However, I recognize that my coffee-making skills are an area for improvement. While I’m enthusiastic about learning, I sometimes feel less confident behind the bar during high-volume periods. I’m committed to dedicating time to practice and seeking feedback so I can become more consistent and efficient in drink preparation.

Manager comments

Strengths:
Annabeth always shows up to the coffee shop on time and ready to start their shift.  They are happy to work the critical, difficult to fill morning weekend hours, and have been working on learning the store opening and closing procedures. They always make sure the equipment is in clean and functioning order for the next shift.

Areas for Improvement:
Annabeth doesn’t know the menu very well, and without the recipe quick guides cannot make the correct coffee beverage. 

Goals for Future Development:
A should learn the different types of coffees available on the menu, and roughly how to prepare them.

Overall Comments:
1-    Stores should make sure the quick guides are up-to-date with the current menu selections as well as common off menu selections
2-    Annabeth should continue to be encouraged to work at the store, and be given additional training for opening and closing the store
3-    Annabeth should be in situations where their strengths of making sure equipment is clean and functional are utilized
4-    Annabeth should be paired with a barista who knows the menu well and can make beverage selections outside of what is printed in the quick guides
