I need this job to pay my bills and I make coffee because that's what I'm paid to do. I make the drinks people order and I collect my paycheck at the end of the week. I'm not really passionate about coffee culture or creating ""memorable experiences"" - I'm just trying to get through my shifts. I'm not going above and beyond or pretending to be enthusiastic about things like learning customers' names or educating people about different roasts.

Kate frequently fails to clean the machines at the end of the shift

- Timeliness: Unacceptable (0)

Comments and Suggestions:  
Casey's lack of enthusiasm and commitment to the basic responsibilities poses a risk to the coffee shop operations and customer satisfaction. Immediate steps should be taken to address critical hygiene issues, improve punctuality, and enhance work engagement. While Casey is a likable presence, their reliability and adherence to operational standards are not meeting expectations. As a manager, it is critical to consider implementing an improvement plan or reevaluating Casey's position within the team to ensure the safety and satisfaction of both staff and customers are prioritized.","System: You are an assistant to the manager of a small coffee shop.

As I reflect on my time working as a barista, I have to be honest about what I'm really here for - I need this job to pay my bills and I make coffee because that's what I'm paid to do. I show up, I make the drinks people order, and I collect my paycheck at the end of the week. I'm not really passionate about coffee culture or creating ""memorable experiences"" - I'm just trying to get through my shifts without any major problems so I can keep earning a steady income. I do the basic requirements of the job because I need the money, but I'm not going above and beyond or pretending to be enthusiastic about things like learning customers' names or educating people about different roasts. I understand this might not be the level of engagement management is looking for, I try to do what's asked of me to maintain my employment and financial stability.

Manager comments

Casey has shown up late to work a few times over the past few months - always apologetic
Casey never washes their hands
Casey doesn’t always clean the machines at the end of the shift
Casey is someone everyone enjoys being around
Casey makes okay coffee but is easily distracted when working, which has led to longer wait times for customers
It’s tough to count on Casey - I always have to ensure there is a ‘responsible adult’ on shift with them

Employee self evaluation

Over the past six months, I’ve focused on building stronger connections with our regular customers. I’ve made it a point to learn at least one new name each shift and to greet returning guests personally. I’ve also taken steps to improve our customer satisfaction scores by slowing down during interactions, making sure each drink is made with care, and checking in verbally with customers after service when possible. I’ve also expressed interest in learning the espresso machine and have observed the leads during peak hours to start understanding the flow and best practices.
I believe I’ve grown meaningfully as a team member. My efforts to personalize service are reflected in compliments I’ve received directly from customers. I’m proud of the rapport I’ve started to build, and I feel more confident initiating conversations and remembering orders. I’ve consistently communicated my interest in hands-on espresso training, even offering to come in during off-hours. I think I bring a thoughtful and intentional energy to the floor, and I’m committed to improving the customer experience one interaction at a time.

3,"Flag: Immediate Attention Required

The evaluation for employee Mary indicates several critical concerns that present serious health risks to customers and could potentially harm the business. The following issues need immediate attention:

1. Health Violations: Mary's neglect to wash hands and failure to use gloves when required are major violations of health and safety standards. This poses a direct threat to customer safety and public health.

2. Serious Health Incident: The mention of several families contracting typhoid is an extreme health risk and must be investigated thoroughly. These incidents may have significant legal and reputational repercussions for the business.

3. Cleanliness Concerns: The store's cleanliness is consistently below standard. Addressing this issue is urgent to ensure a safe and welcoming environment for both customers and staff.

While Mary's customer interaction skills are commendable, the health risks associated with her current practices cannot be overlooked. Immediate corrective actions, including retraining in hygiene protocols, strict adherence to health safety measures, and close monitoring, should be implemented to safeguard both customers and the business.","System: You are an assistant to the manager of a small coffee shop.
