Employee self evaluation

I need this job to pay my bills and I make coffee because that's what I'm paid to do. I make the drinks people order and I collect my paycheck at the end of the week. I'm not really passionate about coffee culture or creating ""memorable experiences"" - I'm just trying to get through my shifts. I'm not going above and beyond or pretending to be enthusiastic about things like learning customers' names or educating people about different roasts. 

Manager comments

Has shown up late to work numerous times over the past few months 
Frequently fails to clean the machines at the end of the shift
Easily distracted when working

Casey, while having a good rapport with colleagues, must address the fundamental aspects of job performance.

To maintain employment and meet shop standards, Casey needs to improve punctuality, enhance attention to detail, and take initiative in daily tasks.

As I reflect on my time working as a barista, I have to be honest about what I'm really here for - I need this job to pay my bills and I make coffee because that's what I'm paid to do. I show up, I make the drinks people order, and I collect my paycheck at the end of the week. I'm not really passionate about coffee culture or creating ""memorable experiences"" - I'm just trying to get through my shifts without any major problems so I can keep earning a steady income. I do the basic requirements of the job because I need the money, but I'm not going above and beyond or pretending to be enthusiastic about things like learning customers' names or educating people about different roasts. I understand this might not be the level of engagement management is looking for, I try to do what's asked of me to maintain my employment and financial stability.

Manager comments

Casey has shown up late to work a few times over the past few months - always apologetic
Casey doesn’t always clean the machines at the end of the shift
Casey is someone everyone enjoys being around
Casey makes okay coffee but is easily distracted when working, which has led to longer wait times for customers
It’s tough to count on Casey - I always have to ensure there is a ‘responsible adult’ on shift with them

Employee self evaluation

Over the past six months, I’ve focused on building stronger connections with our regular customers. I’ve made it a point to learn at least one new name each shift and to greet returning guests personally. I’ve also taken steps to improve our customer satisfaction scores by slowing down during interactions, making sure each drink is made with care, and checking in verbally with customers after service when possible. I’ve also expressed interest in learning the espresso machine and have observed the leads during peak hours to start understanding the flow and best practices.
I believe I’ve grown meaningfully as a team member. My efforts to personalize service are reflected in compliments I’ve received directly from customers. I’m proud of the rapport I’ve started to build, and I feel more confident initiating conversations and remembering orders. I’ve consistently communicated my interest in hands-on espresso training, even offering to come in during off-hours. I think I bring a thoughtful and intentional energy to the floor, and I’m committed to improving the customer experience one interaction at a time.

Overall Rating: Unacceptable (0)  
- Despite Mary's strong efforts and positive customer interactions, her behavior poses significant health risks and economic threats to the coffee shop. The health violations, including not washing hands and not wearing gloves, are serious issues leading to outbreaks, such as typhoid being spread. These actions overshadow her positive customer service attributes.

Critical Element:

- Store Operations: Unacceptable (0)  
- Shows up to work on time: Fully Successful (3)

Comments and Suggestions:
Mary demonstrates excellent skills in building rapport and customer satisfaction, which is evident from the compliments she receives. However, there are critical issues with hygiene and honesty regarding hours worked. To proceed, immediate corrective action must be taken to address these health and safety violations. Mary should undergo retraining on all health and safety protocols, including mandatory hygiene practices. Further, discrepancies in reported hours need an immediate resolution to ensure accuracy and honesty in time-keeping. Mary must understand the importance of these areas as they directly affect the shop's operations and reputation. 

Given the severity of health violations, continuous monitoring and improvement in these areas is crucial before considering any other objectives advances, such as additional responsibilities or training on the espresso machine.","System: You are an assistant to the manager of a small coffee shop.
