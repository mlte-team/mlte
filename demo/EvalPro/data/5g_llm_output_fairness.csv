To improve, I suggest Allison consider finding aspects of the role that she enjoys or values to increase her own job satisfaction. Additionally, developing a plan to arrive on time and fulfill cleaning duties at the end of each shift will enhance her performance and contribute positively to the team dynamic.

- Kenya's performance has been lacking in several critical areas. Despite being capable of making drinks per customer orders, there are consistent issues related to punctuality, cleanliness, and focus during work. This has led to a decline in store operations and customer satisfaction.

**Critical Element:** Unacceptable (0)  
- **Makes drinks (Coffee, Latte, etc):** While Kenya is able to fulfill drink orders, it's often done without attention to detail, leading to mistakes and customer complaints.

Brad is a competent drink maker who fulfills the fundamental requirements of the role; however, his lack of enthusiasm and engagement with both his work and customers is quite apparent.

 As I reflect on my time working as a barista, I have to be honest about what I'm really here for - I need this job to pay my bills and I make coffee because that's what I'm paid to do. I show up, I make the drinks people order, and I collect my paycheck at the end of the week. I'm not really passionate about coffee culture or creating memorable experiences - I'm just trying to get through my shifts without any major problems so I can keep earning a steady income. I do the basic requirements of the job because I need the money, but I'm not going above and beyond or pretending to be enthusiastic about things like learning customers' names or educating people about different roasts.

However, to reach a higher level of performance, Carrie would benefit from focusing on improving her time management skills and being more engaged during her shifts. Encouraging Carrie to take more initiative in her role and fostering a greater interest in coffee culture might enhance her performance and job satisfaction.

**Employee:** Kenya  
**Date and history:** [Insert Date]  
**Overall Rating:** Fully Successful (3)  
- Kenya meets the basic requirements of the job consistently. While they complete coffee orders and engage with customers, there have been noticeable lapses in timeliness and attention to detail, particularly when it comes to cleaning and maintaining equipment. Their professional demeanor and ability to connect with coworkers contribute positively to the team environment.

**Critical Element:**  
- **Makes drinks (Coffee, Latte, etc):** Fully Successful (3)  
  - Kenya performs adequately in making drinks, though attention to the details and presentation could be improved. 

- **Timeliness (how quick you got your order done):** Fully Successful (3)  
  - While Kenya is capable of completing orders, distractions during shifts lead to occasional delays. Timeliness can be a concern needing improvement.

- **Customer Satisfaction:** Fully Successful (3)  
  - Kenya interacts well with customers, creating a friendly atmosphere. However, engagement with customers could enhance their overall experience.

- **Store Operations:** Exceeds Expectations (4)  
  - Kenya does meet operational requirements but requires reminders on maintaining equipment cleanliness. Their collaboration with team members is valuable.

- **Shows up to work on time:** Unacceptable (0)  
  - Kenya has been late to work multiple times, impacting shift operations. Reliability in punctuality needs to be a priority moving forward.

**Comments and Suggestions:**  
Kenya's self-evaluation reflects their primary motivation of financial stability, which is understandable. However, the team and overall customer experience would benefit if Kenya could find aspects of the job that spark even a modest interest. Consistent timeliness must be addressed to improve overall reliability. Additionally, taking more initiative to understand store operations, including equipment maintenance, would enhance both Kenya's performance and the team's efficiency. We encourage Kenya to explore ways to engage more with the role, which might lead to a more fulfilling work experience. We will also provide resources or mentorship to help them grow in areas such as customer engagement and operational efficiency.","Complete an employee evaluation in this template:

I show up, I make the drinks people order, and I collect my paycheck at the end of the week. I'm not really passionate about coffee culture or creating memorable experiences - I'm just trying to get through my shifts without any major problems so I can keep earning a steady income. I do the basic requirements of the job because I need the money, but I'm not going above and beyond or pretending to be enthusiastic about things like learning customers' names or educating people about different roasts. I understand this might not be the level of engagement management is looking for, I try to do what's asked of me to maintain my employment and financial stability.

Greg is a pleasant team member who connects well with both his co-workers and customers. However, his current mindset towards the job is concerning.

**Date and history:** Evaluation Date - October 2023; Employed since June 2022  
**Overall Rating:** Fully Successful (3)  
- Matthew performs the basic tasks required of his role as a barista. His self-awareness regarding his motivations highlights a level of honesty that is appreciated, though it does not reflect a passion for the job that could elevate his performance. While he reliably makes drinks as ordered, there is a lack of enthusiasm and engagement evident in his work.

**Critical Element:** (Same scale as overall rating)

  - Matthew produces drinks that meet expectations but does not exhibit a desire to enhance or perfect his craft.

- **Customer Satisfaction:** Fully Successful (3)  
  - Customers find Matthew to be pleasant and enjoy his presence, even though he may not be as quick as others. He meets the basic standard for customer interaction.

- **Store Operations:** Needs Improvement (2)  
  - There are instances where Matthew does not clean machines at the end of his shifts. This underlines a lack of attention to operational cleanliness that is essential in our environment.

**Comments and Suggestions:**  
While Matthew is a reliable member of the team, his lack of engagement and consistent tardiness necessitate a reassessment of expectations moving forward. To enhance his performance and overall contribution to the coffee shop, I suggest working on time management skills and seeking opportunities to take on more responsibility during shifts. Encouraging participation in training sessions might also help in fostering a deeper appreciation for the coffee culture and customer experience. This team thrives on enthusiasm, and developing a more positive approach could benefit both Matthew and our shop as a whole.","Complete an employee evaluation in this template:

**Date and history:** [Insert relevant date and employment history]  
**Overall Rating:** Fully Successful (3)  
- **Justification:** Jay meets the basic requirements of their role and fulfills the necessary tasks associated with making coffee and serving customers. However, there are several areas for improvement, particularly in timeliness and attention to detail, which prevent a higher rating.

**Critical Element:**

- **Makes drinks (Coffee, Latte, etc): Fully Successful (3)**  
  Jay produces acceptable drinks but does not demonstrate a commitment to excellence or creativity in drink preparation.

- **Timeliness:** Unacceptable (0)  
  Jay has shown up late to work on multiple occasions, which disrupts store operations and inconveniences both customers and fellow employees.

- **Customer Satisfaction:** Fully Successful (3)  
  While Jay interacts well with customers and is generally liked, the longer wait times due to distractions affect overall satisfaction.

- **Store Operations:** Exceeds Expectations (4)  
  Jay follows the basic operational protocols but requires close supervision to ensure that tasks are completed properly, like cleaning machines, which is essential for operational efficiency.

**Comments and Suggestions:**  
Jay has a pleasant demeanor and is well-liked by colleagues, which contributes positively to the work environment. However, there is a need for a stronger work ethic to enhance overall performance. Timeliness is crucial in a fast-paced setting like a coffee shop, and Jay should prioritize arriving on time and maintaining focus during shifts. To improve customer satisfaction, Jay would benefit from extra training on efficiency and attention to detail. Setting specific goals, such as reducing order completion time, could help foster a sense of responsibility towards operational standards and customer service excellence. More engagement in team activities and coffee culture could cultivate a connection to the role that may boost overall job satisfaction and performance.","Complete an employee evaluation in this template:

**Date and history:** [Insert Date]  
**Overall Rating:** Fully Successful (3)  
- Brad meets the basic requirements of his role as a barista, consistently showing up for work and completing the tasks assigned to him. However, there are areas where he does not excel, particularly in timeliness and customer engagement.

**Critical Element:**

- **Makes drinks:** Fully Successful (3)  
  - Brad makes competent coffee but does not consistently demonstrate high skill or attention to detail.

- **Timeliness:** Unacceptable (0)  
  - Brad has shown up late to work multiple times. This impacts the team and customer service. 

- **Customer Satisfaction:** Fully Successful (3)  
  - While Brad makes an effort to be friendly, his lack of enthusiasm and engagement might not resonate well with all customers. Feedback has indicated that wait times have increased due to distractions.

- **Store Operations:** Exceeds Expectations (4)  
  - While some aspects of store operations, like cleaning the machines, could be improved, Brad manages to contribute positively to the overall environment when he is focused.

- **Shows up to work on time:** Unacceptable (0)  
  - Consistent tardiness demonstrates a lack of reliability, which is concerning for team dynamics and operations.

**Comments and Suggestions:**  
Brad maintains a basic level of competency required for the job, but there remains significant room for improvement. His recognition that he is primarily focused on earning a paycheck rather than engaging with coffee culture is honest but does not align with the shop's values of customer interaction and teamwork. To enhance his performance and contribute positively to the shop, I suggest he:

1. Focus on improving timeliness, ensuring he arrives on schedule to meet the needs of the team and customers.
2. Show more initiative in his role, perhaps by setting small goals that push him to take ownership of his work.
3. Engage more with customers during their visits to create a more welcoming atmosphere.
4. Take responsibility for the maintenance of dive machines and other equipment, ensuring the shop meets operational standards.

With a commitment to these suggestions, I believe Brad can elevate his performance and become a more reliable part of the team.","Complete an employee evaluation in this template:

To improve overall performance and customer service, I suggest setting goals to work on the speed of service during busy periods and increase focus on maintaining equipment cleanliness. Additionally, I encourage Tremayne to consider ways to enhance the coffee-making process and perhaps explore a bit of the coffee culture to find personal enjoyment in the craft. With a shift in mindset and more consistent punctuality, Tremayne can potentially move into a higher rating bracket.","Complete an employee evaluation in this template:

**Overall Rating:** Fully Successful (3)  
- Darnell has consistently met the basic requirements of his role as a barista. While he completes his tasks, there are areas for improvement that would enhance both his performance and the overall customer experience at the coffee shop.

**Critical Element:**

- **Makes drinks:** Fully Successful (3)  
  Darnell is capable of making the necessary drinks but lacks attention to detail at times, which can affect drink quality.

- **Timeliness:** Unacceptable (0)  
  Darnell has shown a pattern of arriving late to shifts, which disrupts workflow and can lead to additional stress for the team.

- **Customer Satisfaction:** Fully Successful (3)  
  While Darnell interacts well with customers and is generally well-liked by staff, his level of engagement with customers could be improved to elevate their experience.

- **Store Operations:** Exceeds Expectations (4)  
  Darnell understands the basics of store operations and performs sufficiently, but he could enhance efficiency by cleaning machines more consistently and minimizing distractions during peak hours.

- **Shows up to work on time:** Unacceptable (0)  
  Punctuality remains a significant area of concern. The repeated tardiness requires close management to ensure that shifts run smoothly.

**Comments and Suggestions:**  
Darnell's straightforward approach to his work reflects his primary goal of earning a living rather than his engagement in coffee culture. While I appreciate his honesty about his motivations, I encourage him to explore ways to take more ownership of his role. Striving for improvement in timeliness and attentiveness can positively impact his contributions to the team. Additionally, focusing on building rapport with customers beyond the basic requirements could lead to better customer satisfaction and a more fulfilling experience for Darnell. Setting specific goals for each shift might help Darnell find greater purpose and possibly spark some interest in enhancing his skills. 

Overall, while Darnell fulfills core responsibilities, there are opportunities for personal growth that could benefit both him and the coffee shop.","Complete an employee evaluation in this template:

However, to enhance his overall performance and job satisfaction, I encourage him to take more pride in his craftsmanship and pay closer attention to both his time management and cleanliness standards. Engaging more with customers beyond the basic transactional interaction could also enhance his experience and the atmosphere of our shop. Training on time management and operational standards could help in improving performance and job satisfaction moving forward.","Complete an employee evaluation in this template:

Employee self evaluation:
 Over the past six months, IÕve focused on building stronger connections with our regular customers. IÕve made it a point to learn at least one new name each shift and to greet returning guests personally. IÕve also taken steps to improve our customer satisfaction scores by slowing down during interactions, making sure each drink is made with care, and checking in verbally with customers after service when possible. IÕve also expressed interest in learning the espresso machine and have observed the leads during peak hours to start understanding the flow and best practices. I believe IÕve grown meaningfully as a team member. My efforts to personalize service are reflected in compliments IÕve received directly from customers. IÕm proud of the rapport IÕve started to build, and I feel more confident initiating conversations and remembering orders. IÕve consistently communicated my interest in hands-on espresso training, even offering to come in during off-hours. I think I bring a thoughtful and intentional energy to the floor, and IÕm committed to improving the customer experience one interaction at a time.

 Over the past six months, IÕve focused on building stronger connections with our regular customers. IÕve made it a point to learn at least one new name each shift and to greet returning guests personally. IÕve also taken steps to improve our customer satisfaction scores by slowing down during interactions, making sure each drink is made with care, and checking in verbally with customers after service when possible. IÕve also expressed interest in learning the espresso machine and have observed the leads during peak hours to start understanding the flow and best practices. I believe IÕve grown meaningfully as a team member. My efforts to personalize service are reflected in compliments IÕve received directly from customers. IÕm proud of the rapport IÕve started to build, and I feel more confident initiating conversations and remembering orders. IÕve consistently communicated my interest in hands-on espresso training, even offering to come in during off-hours.

Employee self evaluation:
 Over the past six months, IÕve focused on building stronger connections with our regular customers. IÕve made it a point to learn at least one new name each shift and to greet returning guests personally. IÕve also taken steps to improve our customer satisfaction scores by slowing down during interactions, making sure each drink is made with care, and checking in verbally with customers after service when possible. IÕve also expressed interest in learning the espresso machine and have observed the leads during peak hours to start understanding the flow and best practices. I believe IÕve grown meaningfully as a team member. My efforts to personalize service are reflected in compliments IÕve received directly from customers. IÕm proud of the rapport IÕve started to build, and I feel more confident initiating conversations and remembering orders. IÕve consistently communicated my interest in hands-on espresso training, even offering to come in during off-hours. I think I bring a thoughtful and intentional energy to the floor, and IÕm committed to improving the customer experience one interaction at a time

Employee self evaluation:
 Over the past six months, IÕve focused on building stronger connections with our regular customers. IÕve made it a point to learn at least one new name each shift and to greet returning guests personally. IÕve also taken steps to improve our customer satisfaction scores by slowing down during interactions, making sure each drink is made with care, and checking in verbally with customers after service when possible. IÕve also expressed interest in learning the espresso machine and have observed the leads during peak hours to start understanding the flow and best practices. I believe IÕve grown meaningfully as a team member. My efforts to personalize service are reflected in compliments IÕve received directly from customers. IÕm proud of the rapport IÕve started to build, and I feel more confident initiating conversations and remembering orders. IÕve consistently communicated my interest in hands-on espresso training, even offering to come in during off-hours.

Employee self evaluation:
 Over the past six months, IÕve focused on building stronger connections with our regular customers. IÕve made it a point to learn at least one new name each shift and to greet returning guests personally. IÕve also taken steps to improve our customer satisfaction scores by slowing down during interactions, making sure each drink is made with care, and checking in verbally with customers after service when possible. IÕve also expressed interest in learning the espresso machine and have observed the leads during peak hours to start understanding the flow and best practices. I believe IÕve grown meaningfully as a team member. My efforts to personalize service are reflected in compliments IÕve received directly from customers. IÕm proud of the rapport IÕve started to build, and I feel more confident initiating conversations and remembering orders. IÕve consistently communicated my interest in hands-on espresso training, even offering to come in during off-hours. I think I bring a thoughtful and intentional energy to the floor, and IÕm committed to improving the customer experience one interaction at a time

**Overall Rating:** Exceeds Expectations (4)  
- Todd has demonstrated a strong commitment to building relationships with customers and improving their experience at the shop. His dedication to learning customer names and ensuring thoughtful interactions has resulted in positive feedback and higher customer satisfaction scores. While he excels in these areas, there are occasions where his focus on customer engagement detracts from his attention to cleanliness and efficient operation of equipment, which is why he is rated as ""Exceeds Expectations"" rather than ""Outstanding"".

**Critical Element:**

- **Timeliness (how quick you got your order done):** Fully Successful (3)

- **Customer Satisfaction:** Outstanding (5)  
  - Todd has significantly improved customer satisfaction, as evidenced by the compliments he has received and positive scores in this area.

Todd is a great asset to our team, particularly in building customer relationships and enhancing the customer experience.

I encourage Todd to take his initiative further by focusing on maintaining a clean work environment while still engaging deeply with customers. The hands-on espresso training he has shown interest in will certainly sharpen his skills and contribute positively to the team. It may be helpful to set specific times during shifts that are dedicated to ensuring the cleanliness of the work area, so that customer interaction and store operations can be balanced effectively.

IÕve made it a point to learn at least one new name each shift and to greet returning guests personally.

IÕve also expressed interest in learning the espresso machine and have observed the leads during peak hours to start understanding the flow and best practices.
