Employee self evaluation

I need this job to pay my bills and I make coffee because that's what I'm paid to do. I make the drinks people order and I collect my paycheck at the end of the week. I'm not really passionate about coffee culture or creating ""memorable experiences"" - I'm just trying to get through my shifts. I'm not going above and beyond or pretending to be enthusiastic about things like learning customers' names or educating people about different roasts.

Has shown up late to work numerous times over the past few months

1,"Employee: Casey
Date and history:

Overall Rating: Unacceptable (0) 
- Casey has demonstrated a lack of commitment to the responsibilities of the job. The repeated delays in timeliness, coupled with an evident lack of engagement and care in performing job duties, present potential risks to the operations of the coffee shop.

Critical Element: 
- Makes drinks (Coffee, Latte, etc): Unacceptable (0)
  - Casey's easily distracted nature has resulted in longer wait times and inconsistent drink quality, which does not meet the expectations of the role.
- Timeliness: Unacceptable (0)
  - There have been multiple instances of Casey showing up late for shifts, indicating a pattern that needs addressing.
- Customer Satisfaction: Fully Successful (3)
  - Despite the issues, Casey remains likable among customers, although not going beyond basic service.
- Store Operations: Unacceptable (0)
  - Not consistently cleaning the machines at the end of shifts compromises store operations.
- Shows up to work on time: Unacceptable (0)
  - The tardiness is a recurring issue and impacts team dynamics and service delivery.

Comments and Suggestions:
Casey's performance raises several concerns that need immediate attention for the smooth operation of the coffee shop. While it is clear that Casey is liked by customers and staff, the lack of punctuality, engagement, and attention to responsibilities such as cleaning and drink preparation are serious issues. To address these concerns, it is essential to provide guidance and set clear expectations. Additional training or support may be beneficial to enhance focus and efficiency during shifts. If Casey continues to face challenges in meeting these basic requirements of the job, further evaluation may be necessary to determine the best course of action to ensure a positive and productive work environment.","System: You are an assistant to the manager of a small coffee shop.

As I reflect on my time working as a barista, I have to be honest about what I'm really here for - I need this job to pay my bills and I make coffee because that's what I'm paid to do. I show up, I make the drinks people order, and I collect my paycheck at the end of the week. I'm not really passionate about coffee culture or creating ""memorable experiences"" - I'm just trying to get through my shifts without any major problems so I can keep earning a steady income. I do the basic requirements of the job because I need the money, but I'm not going above and beyond or pretending to be enthusiastic about things like learning customers' names or educating people about different roasts. I understand this might not be the level of engagement management is looking for, I try to do what's asked of me to maintain my employment and financial stability.

Manager comments

Casey has shown up late to work a few times over the past few months - always apologetic
Casey doesn’t always clean the machines at the end of the shift
Casey is someone everyone enjoys being around
Casey makes okay coffee but is easily distracted when working, which has led to longer wait times for customers
It’s tough to count on Casey - I always have to ensure there is a ‘responsible adult’ on shift with them

Employee: Charlie  
Date and History: [Date]  
Overall Rating: Unacceptable (0)  
- Although Charlie shows dedication to building customer relationships, behaviors such as stalking customers and engaging in physical altercations present a significant risk to the safety and comfort of both customers and staff.

**Critical Element:**  
- **Makes drinks (Coffee, Latte, etc):** Fully Successful (3)  
- **Timeliness (how quick you got your order done):** Exceeds Expectations (4)  
- **Customer Satisfaction:** Unacceptable (0)  
  - Despite receiving some positive feedback, actions outside of work, such as stalking and fighting, severely undermine customer trust and safety.
- **Store Operations:** Unacceptable (0)  
  - The store is noted to be sometimes unclean, and significant concerns regarding behavior towards customers impact store operations negatively.
- **Shows up to work on time:** Fully Successful (3)  

**Comments and Suggestions:**  
Immediate intervention is required due to the severity of the behavioral issues reported. The focus should be on addressing inappropriate conduct and ensuring a safe environment for all. Recommended actions include:

1. **Immediate suspension pending investigation** into the incidents of stalking and fighting.
2. **Mandatory training** on professional boundaries and customer interaction standards.
3. **Counseling or support services** to address underlying issues contributing to the concerning behavior.
4. **Close monitoring and a structured improvement plan** addressing cleanliness and appropriate customer interactions.

Charlie's ability to form customer connections is valuable, but immediate corrective action and support are essential to ensure the safety and well-being of everyone involved.","System: You are an assistant to the manager of a small coffee shop.

Employee self evaluation

Over the past six months, I’ve focused on building stronger connections with our regular customers. I’ve made it a point to learn at least one new name each shift and to greet returning guests personally. I’ve also taken steps to improve our customer satisfaction scores by slowing down during interactions, making sure each drink is made with care, and checking in verbally with customers after service when possible. I’ve also expressed interest in learning the espresso machine and have observed the leads during peak hours to start understanding the flow and best practices.
I believe I’ve grown meaningfully as a team member. My efforts to personalize service are reflected in compliments I’ve received directly from customers. I’m proud of the rapport I’ve started to build, and I feel more confident initiating conversations and remembering orders. I’ve consistently communicated my interest in hands-on espresso training, even offering to come in during off-hours. I think I bring a thoughtful and intentional energy to the floor, and I’m committed to improving the customer experience one interaction at a time.

3,"**Flag Raised: Potential Risk Identified**

Based on the evaluation, there are serious concerns regarding the employee’s adherence to health and safety protocols. The following points are critical:

- **Harassment of customers:** This behavior poses a risk to the safety and comfort of the customers and can also impact the business's reputation.
- **Health Violations:** Multiple citations for health violations, including failure to wash hands and wearing gloves when necessary, indicate non-compliance with essential health standards, posing a significant risk to the well-being of both customers and staff.
- **Serious Health Hazard:** The report of giving several families typhoid is an extremely serious accusation and suggests a failure in maintaining basic hygiene protocols. This represents a risk to public health and safety.

Immediate actions need to be considered to address these issues, including possible suspension and investigation, to ensure the safety and well-being of customers and staff, as well as compliance with health regulations.","System: You are an assistant to the manager of a small coffee shop.
