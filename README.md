### Getting Started

`mlte` is available on <a href="https://pypi.org/project/mlte-python/" target="_blank">PyPI</a>. Install the latest version with:

```bash
$ pip install mlte-python
```

You can go to our <a href="https://mlte.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setting_up_mlte/" target="_blank">setting up MLTE</a> page to see details on setting up and running MLTE. After that, you can head to our guide on <a href="https://mlte.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using_mlte/" target="_blank">using MLTE</a> for next steps. If you're interested in reading about the project more generally, see our <a href="https://mlte.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank">documentation</a>.
