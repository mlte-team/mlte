# `MLTE`: Machine Learning Test and Evaluation

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mlte-team/mlte/master/assets/MLTE_Logo_Color.svg" alt="mlte_logo" width="150"/>

`MLTE` (pronounced "melt") is a framework and infrastructure for evaluating machine learning models and systems. To get started with the `MLTE` Python package, continuing reading below. The `MLTE` framework can be found in the <a href="https://mlte.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank">documentation</a>, along with a more in-depth guide to <a href="https://mlte.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using_mlte/" target="_blank">using `MLTE`</a> that expands on the quick start guide below. For examples of use cases, see the <a href="https://github.com/mlte-team/mlte/tree/master/demo" target="_blank">demo folder</a>.

## Quick Start

The `MLTE` Python package is available on <a href="https://pypi.org/project/mlte/" target="_blank">PyPI</a>, and the `MLTE` framework is described in our <a href="https://mlte.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank">documentation</a>. Install the latest version of the package with pip or conda:

```bash
$ pip install mlte
```

To use the web UI (frontend/backend functionality), the `frontend` optional dependencies are needed; to use relational database storage, the `rdbs` optional dependencies are needed; and to use the GPU measurements, the `gpu` optional dependencies are needed. To install all optional dependencies:

```bash
$ pip install "mlte[frontend,rdbs,gpu]"
```

### Building `MLTE`
If you want to build `MLTE` from its source code in this repository, see the <a href="https://mlte.readthedocs.io/en/latest/development/" target="_blank">development section</a> of the MLTE docs  for details on setting up a local environment to build and run MLTE from source. 

To build the `MLTE` wheel from source in an isolated Docker environment, without setting up a local environment (the output will be in the `./dist` folder), run the following command:
```bash
$ make build-in-docker
```

### Using `MLTE` as a Library

`MLTE` can be imported and used as a regular library to access most of its functionality by importing the ``mlte`` package. Before most operations can be done on `MLTE`, a context and store need to be set via ``set_context("model_name", "model_version")`` and ``set_store("store_uri")``, which can be imported as follows:

```python
from mlte.session import set_context, set_store
```
``set_context()`` indicates the model and version being used for the script, and can be any string. ``set_store()`` indicates the location of the store being used for artifacts and other entities, with four store type options described in the <a href="https://mlte.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using_mlte/" target="_blank">documentation</a>. The MLTE context and store can alternatively be set by environment variables before starting the script (``MLTE_CONTEXT_MODEL``, ``MLTE_CONTEXT_VERSION``, and ``MLTE_STORE_URI``), and can later be overridden using the set methods above.

For a simple example of using the `MLTE` library, see the simple demo Jupyter notebooks available <a href="https://github.com/mlte-team/mlte/tree/master/demo/simple" target="_blank">here</a>. 

### Running `MLTE`'s Web UI

The `MLTE` web-based user interface (UI) allows you to view stored artifacts, create/edit some of them, and review existing models and test catalogs. To access the UI, first start the backend server with the following command:

```bash
$ mlte backend
```

There are a number of flags that can be used to specify parameters; see the backend section of the <a href="https://mlte.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using_mlte/" target="_blank">using `MLTE`</a> page for details. The default artifact store puts artifacts into a non-persistent, in-memory store. For example, running the backend with a store located in a folder called `store` relative to the folder where you are running `MLTE` would use the following command:

  ```bash
    $ mlte backend --store-uri fs://store
  ```

Once the backend is running, you can run the UI with the following command:

```bash
$ mlte ui
```

After this, go to the hosted address (defaults to `http://localhost:8000`) to view the `MLTE` UI homepage. You will need to log in to access the functionality in the UI, which you can do by using the default user. You can later use the UI to set up new users as well.

**NOTE**: you should change the default user's password as soon as you can, if you are not on a local setup.

* Default user: admin
* Default password: admin1234

## Next Steps

The `MLTE` Python package is best used in conjunction with the `MLTE` <a href="https://mlte.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank">process framework</a>. For more details on using the package, see our documentation page on <a href="https://mlte.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using_mlte/" target="_blank">using `MLTE`</a>.
