mlte/web/store/api/dependencies.py

This file defines common dependencies that are used by API functions.
In practice, this ensures that the backend is initialized prior to
attempting to service any incoming requests.

Originally, I used FastAPI dependency injection to manage dependencies,
but it became so much harder to manage the fact that initialization was
occurring at import time rather than at invocation time that I removed
this in favor of slightly more brittle but eminently more workable
solution that involves manual context management with a global state object.
