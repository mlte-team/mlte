        Requirements
        <template #info>
          <p>
            These are the requirements and constraints derived from the
            ML-enabled system that integrates the model under development. The
            fields below correspond to parts of a quality attribute scenario,
            which is a construct used to clearly define system requirements.
            <br />
            <br />
            As the parts of the scenario are filled in, the corresponding text
            for the scenario will be automatically generated. Edit the fields
            such that the generated scenario corresponds to a coherent
            paragraph; these fields simply ensure that all parts of the scenario
            are considered and form a concrete, testable requirement. Click on
            the "Example" button below for a list of examples.
